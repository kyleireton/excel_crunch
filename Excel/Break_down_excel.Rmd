# full setup from scratch

```{r}
# first, you need to install `usethis`
# install.packages("usethis")
```


```{r}
# Add authentication information:
# Use your GitHub user name and associated email address.

# usethis::use_git_config(
#   user.name = "kyleireton",
#   user.email = "kyle.ireton@gmail.com"
# )

```


```{r}
# feel free to write a more appropriate description.
# default scopes of the token should work fine.
## usethis::create_github_token(description = "connect this session to github")
# make sure to store your token in a save place, e.g. a password manager.
# I currently use bitwarden, which is free and open source.
```


```{r}

# usethis::edit_r_environ()

# add github token to .Renviron as:
# GITHUB_PAT = *your token here*
```

```{r}
# finally, add your token to the machine. Use:

# gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

# And enter the created GH-Token in the R console when prompted

```

Let's break an excel file into its individual tabs as .csv's in the same directory

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# install.packages("readxl")
# install.packages("writexl")

library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r}

# Specify the path to the Excel file
excel_file <- "ExcelMock1.xlsx"

excel_file

# Read the Excel file

sheets <- excel_sheets(excel_file)

# Loop through each sheet and save it as a separate CSV file
for (sheet in sheets) {
  
  data <- read_excel(excel_file, sheet = sheet)
  
  # Remove invalid characters from the sheet name to use it as the CSV file name
  csv_file <- paste0(gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", sheet), ".csv")
  
  # Save the sheet as a CSV file in the same directory
  write_xlsx(data, csv_file)
  
  # Provide feedback on the process
  cat("Saved", sheet, "as", csv_file, "/n")
  
}


```


```{r}



```
